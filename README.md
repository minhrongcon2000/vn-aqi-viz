## Available features
- Scrolly-telling (graph changes as the web page is scrolled)
- Easy-to-understand graph with meaningful information

## Interesting information found on Vietnam air condition
- The AQI is high even though forest area keeps expanding (in exponential form), implying that human activities outperform the supply of oxygen from forests.
- Coals, oils, and related products are the main causes of high AQI; therefore, solutions to less rely on these energy sources should be put on first priority
